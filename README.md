# BottleDrainer
High School Project that consisted of creating an Object capable of draining all types of bottles

The first part of the project was about creating the BottleDrainer, from drawing prototypes to building them and testing them. Multiple version were drawn, assembled then tested to keep only the most resistant and stable design.

The second part of the project was about the advertisment of the project. I decided to do a 30 seconds advertisement video in french and english that can be found here:
ENG: https://youtu.be/0THhWnnZnPA
FR: https://youtu.be/ME3r2rF-jJU
A business plan with multiple campaign ideas was also designed. It involved doing a website with front and backend and a market study. 

Both parts have a report to reflect about the work done and the difficulties encountered

Example of the bottle drainer in action.
