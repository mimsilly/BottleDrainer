# BottleDrainer
High School Project that consisted of creating an Object capable of draining all types of bottles

The first part of the project was about creating the BottleDrainer, from drawing prototypes to creating them and testing them. 
There was also an advertisement to do for the created product. I decided to do a 30 seconds advertisement video in french and english that can be found here:
ENG: https://youtu.be/0THhWnnZnPA

The second part of the project was about selling the BottleDrainer. It involved doing a website with front and backend and a market study. 

Both parts have a report to reflect about the work done and the difficulties encountered
